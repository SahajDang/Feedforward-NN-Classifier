# Feedforward-NN-Classifier

A Feedforward Neural Network implemented using TensorFlow for binary classification with model evaluation and visualization.

## 🔍 Overview

This mini project demonstrates the implementation of a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to classify a synthetic binary dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and includes multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation and a sigmoid output layer. The training is monitored using early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## 🚀 Features

- Multi-layer feedforward neural network
- Data standardization with `StandardScaler`
- Early stopping mechanism
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualization of training vs. validation loss and accuracy

## 📦 Libraries Used

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SahajDang/Feedforward-NN-Classifier.git
